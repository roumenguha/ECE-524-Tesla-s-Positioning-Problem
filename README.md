# Tesla-s-Positioning-Problem-An-Optimized-Solution
This project was completed for ECE 524: Introduction to Optimization at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, in the Spring of 2017. More information about this class can be found here: http://www.laurentlessard.com/teaching/524-intro-to-optimization/

The code is contained in ZhouGuha.ipynb. You can view the code by installing Julia (this project was coded with Julia 0.5.1, so any version in the 0.5 series should work). You will need to have IJulia installed to run the code in Jupyter. 

Alternatively, you can download the Jupyter notebook file (.ipynb) and upload it to JuliaBox.com to view it there. 

And if you don't need to run the code, there is a PDF printout of the notebook, listed as ZhouGuha.pdf.
